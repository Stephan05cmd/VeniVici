Submitted by: **Stephan Pierre**

This web app: **Utilizing DOG API I took dog photos and then saved them so you could remember them.**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [ ] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
  - [ ] To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes
- [ ] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It was most definetly the API calling because of how difficuly it was to understand await and async. It was confusing ono what you want to retirieve from the API and then call it so that it can display the data that you want.
